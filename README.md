Resume Builder
A lightweight, web-based application for creating professional resumes with a clean and modern design. This project uses HTML for structure and CSS for styling, providing a responsive and visually appealing interface. Below, you'll find a detailed explanation of the implementation.


HTML Structure
The project uses a minimal HTML structure:

Main Heading: An <h1> tag displays "Resume Builder" at the top, styled for prominence.
Form Container: A <div> with id="resumeForm" holds input fields for user data (e.g., name, education, experience).
Output Container: A <div> with class="container" serves as the placeholder for the formatted resume output.


CSS Styling
The styling is implemented with a focus on consistency, interactivity, and visual hierarchy:

Global Styles:
Resets margins and padding: * { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; }
Sets a serif font stack: 'Times New Roman', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif
Applies a light background: #eef1f6
Form Container (#resumeForm):
White background with rounded corners (border-radius: 8px)
Subtle shadow (box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1))
Centered with a max-width of 500px

JAVASCRIPT
Form Handling: JavaScript could capture input data from #resumeForm and populate .container with a formatted resume.
Event Listeners: A button click could trigger the generation process.
Dynamic Updates: Real-time preview updates as users type could be added with input event listeners.
